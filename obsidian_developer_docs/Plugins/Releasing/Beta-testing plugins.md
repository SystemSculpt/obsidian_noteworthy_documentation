Before you [[Submit your plugin|submit your plugin]], you may want to let users try it out first. While Obsidian doesn't officially support beta releases, we recommend that you use the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin to distribute your plugin to beta testers before it's been published.

For more information, refer to the [BRAT](https://tfthacker.com/BRAT) documentation.
