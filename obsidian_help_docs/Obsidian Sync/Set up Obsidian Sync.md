In this guide, you'll enable [[Introduction to Obsidian Sync|Obsidian Sync]] for your vault.

## Regional sync servers

Obsidian Sync allows you to choose the hosting location for your remote vault. If you're using version 1.4.16 or older of Obsidian, the location will be automatically chosen for you.

If you're unsure where your current vault's region is, check out [[Obsidian Sync/Security and privacy#Where can I find my current Sync server and where is it hosted?|Where can I find my current Sync server and where is it hosted?]] for guidance.

After selecting a location, it's crucial to be aware that the data center **cannot** be changed afterward. If you wish to relocate your data, the process involves recreating a remote vault and specifying the desired hosting location during the setup.
