## FAQ

### Purchasing process

**Can I try Obsidian for commercial use before paying?**
Yes. You and your team may evaluate Obsidian for commercial use for 14 days. You don't need to pay before evaluating.

**Are there bulk discounts?**
Yes. If you are purchasing more than 20 seats you may be eligible for bulk pricing. Please [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|contact Obsidian support]].

**Can I buy a license for myself, or do I have to ask my company to buy it for me?**
Yes. You can buy a license for yourself by going to your [Account dashboard](https://obsidian.md/account). Most companies allow you to submit an expense report for the purchase.

Some companies may have a different procurement process. Ask your IT department to [[Help and support#Contact Obsidian support|contact Obsidian support]] if they have questions or require specific paperwork.

**Can I purchase a commercial license for multiple employees?**

After purchasing the license, you will receive a license key which you can send to employees to activate their license — see instructions above to activate the license.
