> [!faq]- Why is the generator not working even though I have paid for GPT and haven't exceeded usage? You may need to check ?
> if the payment for the API access is active and separate from the ChatGPT Plus subscription. The API typically requires its own payment plan. Ensure that your account has the appropriate API quota available and that the payment for API access is current and has not encountered any issues. If the problem persists, contacting support with details of your account and any error messages would be the next step.

>[!faq]- Can I use open source LLMs like Mistral? 
>Yes, you can utilize open source Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mistral by leveraging platforms like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) or [GPT4all](https://gpt4all.io/). To switch from the OpenAI model to a local one, you simply need to adjust the `baseUrl` parameter in your configuration to point to the local URL where your chosen open source LLM is hosted. Ensure you have the model properly set up and accessible at the specified URL.
