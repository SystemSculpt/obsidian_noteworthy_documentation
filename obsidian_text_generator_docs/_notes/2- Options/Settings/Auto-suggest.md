> **`Auto-suggest`** is the new option of Text Generator that allows you to get suggestions as you type. These suggestions can be words or phrases or even paragraphs that you can use to complete your text. Which gives you more options to choose from and makes the process of writing your text much faster and controllable.

You can set the delay time in milliseconds for triggering an Auto-suggest to avoid unnecessary requests. 
* **Number of suggestions** :

* ***Stop Phrase*** :

> [!note] Stop Phrase
> **Stop Phrase** is a way to signal to the model generating the text when you want it to stop generating text. It could be a character like a space or period, or even a line break. This can be useful in auto suggestion when you want to complete by **words** (using space ` ` as a stop phrase), **sentences** (using dot `.` as a stop phrase), or **paragraphs** (using line break `\n` as a stop phrase).
