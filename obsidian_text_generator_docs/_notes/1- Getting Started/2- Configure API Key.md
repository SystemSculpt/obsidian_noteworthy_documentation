## **Configuring Text Generator Plugin in Obsidian**

After installing the Text Generator Plugin in Obsidian and enabling it, you'll need to configure the plugin to work with your desired language model provider. Text Generator supports several large language models, including **OpenAI**, **Azure**, **Google**, **Anthropic**, and **Meta**, along with the option to use custom models.

## **Setting Up API Key**

1. Go to **Obsidian settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Text Generator settings**.
3. Choose the **language model provider** you want to use.
4. Set the **API Key** provided by the chosen provider.

## **OpenAI Configuration**

For OpenAI & Azure, there are two modes available:

- **Chat Mode**: This mode is used for conversation-based tasks and is compatible with gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 models. For more information, refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).

- **Instruct Mode**: This mode is used for completion-based tasks and is compatible with the gpt-3.5-instruct model.

Here's an example of configuring OpenAI Chat:

1. Obtain your OpenAI Access Token. You can refer to the documentation on how to get it.
