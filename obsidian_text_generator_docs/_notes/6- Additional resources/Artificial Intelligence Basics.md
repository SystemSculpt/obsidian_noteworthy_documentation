# Generative Artificial Intelligence

**Generative artificial intelligence** is a subfield of AI that focuses on generating new data such artwork, music, or even text.. This can be done either by creating new data from scratch, or by transforming existing data into new forms.
# Transformer

A **transformer** is a neural network architecture for natural language processing (NLP) that can be used for text classification, machine translation, and other NLP tasks. It was proposed in[2017 by researchers at Google](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html).
